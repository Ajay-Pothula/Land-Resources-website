        <p><b>Land Resources Management</b> refers to the responsible and sustainable administration, utilization, and connservation of land and its various components.
        <div>
            It involves the strategic planning, supervision, and governance of land use to hold its ecological well-being and welfare. It refers to managing the use and development of land resources.
            Land being over used or misused can be degraded and reduce the productivity and disrupts the environment.

            <li><h3>Crop Rotation</h3></li><br>
            <i><b>Crop Rotation</b></i> is a farming practice where different crops are planted in a sequential order over time on the same piece of land. It aims to improve soil fertility, reduced pest and enhanced crop yield.<br>
             By alternating crops, it helps to prevent soil depletion by varying nutrient needs. This practice has been used for centuries and remains as a fundamental technique in sustainable agriculture.<br>

              <p id="slm">If a farmer plants the exact same crop in the same place every year, as is <br>common in conventional farming, she continually draws the same nutrients <br> out of the soil. Pests and diseases happily make themselves <br>a permanent home as their preferred food source is guaranteed. With <br>monocultures like these, increasing levels of chemical fertilizers and pesticides <br>become necessary to keep yields high while keeping bugs and disease at bay.<br>

                Crop rotation helps return nutrients to the soil without synthetic inputs.</p>

                <i><b>Water Conservtion </b></i> mainly refers to protect, preserve, and control the usage of water and its resources. It is the system introduced to manage freshwater, reduce the wastage and protect the water and its resources in order to reduce and to avoid the scarcity. Therefore, we all should come forward to create awareness about conservation of water among our own friends, family, neighbours, society, etc. Conservation of water is very much essential as it saves life on earth.

        <p id="biodiversity"><li><h3>Increased Biodiversity</h3></li><br>
        <i><b>Biodiversity</b></i> provides resources and income, particularly in rural areas. A large percentage of the rural population, i.e., between 50% and 90%, depends on ecosystem services for their livelihood. Biodiversity supports humans by providing firewood, freshwater supply, a diverse range of medicinal plants, food, etc. Therefore, biodiversity conservation will help maintain the long-term economic, social, and environmental resilience of rural livelihood, which could help reduce poverty.

                Biodiversity refers to the variety or range of life in a particular area. This <br>includes animals, plants and micro-organisms at the genetic, species and <br>ecosystem levels. Besides its aesthetic and ethical value, biodiversity is,<br> most importantly, the backbone of resilient ecosystems and a stable climate.<br>Biodiversity maintains the ecological balance.
                It helps in the healthy <br>existence of humans and other species in the ecosystem.<br>Biodiversity provides humans with valuable genetic diversity

        <li><h3>Sustainable Grazing Practices</h3></li><br>
        <i><b>Sustainable Grazing Practices </b></i>Animal grazing systems that mimic natural ecosystems, help build healthy soils, sequester large amounts of carbon, and foster biodiversity are preferred. Protection of air quality, water quality, soil health, and wildlife habitat must be the highest priority. Solutions for <b>Grazing</b> practices include <br>

            <li><b>Integrated (or mixed) crop live-stock</b></li>traditional farming practices where both crops and livestock are raised<br> on the same farm, and the livestock are allowed to graze on cover crops<br> or forbs either between the rows of cash crops or trees, or <br>during off season. 
            <li><b>Monitoring</b></li> Regular Monitoring of land conditions, animal health, and adjusting grazing<br> practices accordingly is essential to maintain sustainability over time.

        <i><b>Wildlife Management </b></i> is crucial for preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystems. It helps balance human needs with the protection of wildlife and ecosystems, contributing to a healthier planet. This wildlife management includes many things such as rotational grazing, maintanance of pasture health, water management, ecosystem consideration and adaptation.

            Types of Wildlife Management
            <ul>
                <li><b>Manupulative Management</b></li> acts on a population, either changing its numbers by direct means or <br>influencing numbers by the indirect means of altering food supply, habitat,<br> density of predators, or prevalence of disease. This is appropriate<br> when a population is to be harvested, or when it slides to an unacceptably <br>low density or increases to an unacceptably high level.
                <li><b>Custodial Management</b> </li>is preventive or protective. The aim is to minimize external influences<br> on the population and its habitat. It is appropriate in a national park where<br> one of the stated goals is to protect ecological processes. It is <br>also appropriate for conservation of a threatened species where the threat<br> is of external origin rather than being intrinsic to the system.

            <p><h2>Land Use</h2></p><hr>
            <p id="slm">Land use involves the management and modification of natural environment or wilderness into built environment such as settlements and semi-natural habitats such as arable fields, pastures, and managed woods. Land use by humans has a long history, first emerging more than 10,000 years ago.</p>
        <img src="WhatsApp Image 2023-11-08 at 7.05.10 PM.jpeg">
        <p><h3>Regulation</h3></p><hr>
        <p id="slm">Land use practices vary considerably across the world. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization Water Development Division explains that "Land use concerns the products and/or benefits obtained from use of the land as well as the land management actions (activities) carried out by humans to produce those products and benefits."As of the early 1990s, about 13% of the Earth was considered arable land, with 26% in pasture, 32% forests and woodland, and 1.5% urban areas. Land change modeling can be used to predict and assess future shifts in land use.</p>
